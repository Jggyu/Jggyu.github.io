We participated in Oasis Hackathon 2024 and developed a service called ‘Honam People’. This service is a platform that provides users with a spontaneous and fun travel experience through the game of darts.

Key features:
- Random travel destination selection through dart game
- Providing local information using public API
- Honam region-specific travel recommendation system

Through this hackathon, we gained experience in teamwork, rapid prototyping, and service development using public data. The 'Honam People' service won the grand prize in recognition of its potential to contribute to revitalizing local tourism.
