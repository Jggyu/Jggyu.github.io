Basic study of data structures and algorithms is actively underway in the ALPS club.

<!--more-->

Currently, the ALPS club is running a basic study on data structures and algorithms to improve programming skills. Through regular meetings twice a week, we learn a variety of topics from basic data structures to basic algorithms.

## Lessons learned so far:

1. Basic data structure
   - Arrays and linked lists
   - Stacks and queues
   - Tree base

2. Basic algorithm
   - Sorting algorithm (bubble, selection, insertion)
   - Search algorithm (linear search, binary search)
   - Introduction to recursive algorithms

3. Problem-solving strategies
   - Brute force approach
   - Introduction to simple greedy algorithm

## Future study plans:

1. Advanced data structures
   - graph
   - hash table

2. Additional algorithms
   - Advanced sorting algorithms (quick, merge)
   - Dynamic programming basics
   - Introduction to backtracking

3. Advanced problem-solving strategies
   - Divide and conquer
   - More complex greedy algorithm cases

4. Preparing for coding tests
   - Time complexity and space complexity analysis
   - Practical problem solving and code review sessions

Study is conducted based on a systematic curriculum, and members actively participate and discuss. Each session focuses on improving practical coding skills by combining theoretical learning with solving related problems.

In particular, we have the opportunity to share various solutions and improve code quality through code review sessions held for each topic. Through this, participants gain valuable experience in being able to objectively evaluate and improve their code.

The results of the study to date have shown that the participants' algorithmic thinking skills are gradually improving, and their basic problem-solving skills are also improving significantly.

The ALPS club expects that this Basic Study will help participants prepare fundamentally for programming competitions and coding tests. After completing the study, we will decide the direction of the advanced study to be conducted in the next semester based on the participants' feedback.

We hope that this study will help ALPS club members improve their programming skills and serve as a solid foundation for their future development careers. We look forward to continued passion and effort from all participants.
