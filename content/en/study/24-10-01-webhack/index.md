Basic web hacking studies are actively underway.

<!--more-->

We are running a basic web hacking study to improve your understanding of web security and practical skills. Through regular meetings once a week, we learn a variety of topics, from the basic concepts of web hacking to actual vulnerability analysis and response methods.

## Lessons learned so far:

1. Web Hacking Overview
   - Definition and types of web hacking
   - Ethical aspects and legal considerations of hacking

2. Web application basics
   - Understand HTTP/HTTPS protocols
   - Interaction between web browser and web server

3. Basic web vulnerabilities
   - SQL injection basics
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) overview
   - Introduction to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

4. Introduction to web hacking tools
   - Basic usage of Burp Suite
   - Introduction to OWASP ZAP

## Future study plans:

1. Advanced web vulnerabilities
   - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
   - XML ​​External Entity Injection (XXE)
   - Unsafe deserialization

2. Authentication and session management vulnerabilities
   - Analysis of weak authentication mechanisms
   - Session hijacking techniques

3. Client-side vulnerabilities
   - DOM-based XSS
   - Clickjacking

4. Web application defense techniques
   - Secure coding basics
   - Understanding and bypassing web firewalls (WAF)

5. Practical hacking mock-up practice
   - Practice using OWASP WebGoat
   - Analysis of actual vulnerable web applications

The study is conducted based on a systematic curriculum under the guidance of mentor Lee Jin-gyu, and members actively participate and discuss. Each session focuses on improving practical web hacking skills by combining theoretical learning with demonstrations of actual vulnerabilities and practice of response methods.

In particular, we provide an opportunity to immediately apply what you have learned through CTF (Capture The Flag) style mini challenges for each topic. Through this, participants are gaining experience in real web hacking scenarios.

The results of the study to date have shown that participants' understanding of web security has significantly improved, and their ability to analyze basic vulnerabilities is also gradually improving.

Through this basic web hacking study, we expect that participants will be able to lay the foundation for participating in future security-related competitions or starting a career as a penetration testing tester. After completing the study, we plan to plan a more in-depth advanced web hacking course based on participants' feedback.

We hope that this study will help members improve their web security capabilities and serve as a solid foundation for their future cybersecurity careers. As a mentor, I support the continued passion and effort of all participants and look forward to growing together.
