For the past six months, our study group has been studying hard with the goal of obtaining a level 2 network administrator certification. Through regular weekly meetings, we conducted a variety of learning activities ranging from basic network theory to solving practical problems.

## Key learnings:

1. Network basic theory
   - OSI 7-layer model
   - TCP/IP protocol stack

2. Network equipment and cabling
   - Functions and differences between routers, switches, and hubs
   - UTP cable types and characteristics

3. IP address scheme and subnetting
   - Calculate IPv4 address class and subnet mask
   - Understand and apply CIDR notation

4. Network Security Basics
   - Firewall settings and operation
   - VPN concept and implementation method

5. Network problem solving and troubleshooting
   - Utilize basic commands such as ping and traceroute
   - Packet analysis practice using Wireshark

Success factors for a study group include establishing a systematic study plan, actively sharing knowledge among members, and practicing mock exams similar to the actual exam. In particular, sharing actual cases based on each person's work experience was very helpful.

Based on this achievement, our group plans to continue learning by setting a new goal of acquiring a level 1 network manager certification. Given the rapid pace of advancement in network technology, we all recognize the need for continuous learning and self-development.

The successful operation experience of this study group is expected to serve as a good model for preparing for other IT certifications in the future. We would like to congratulate and thank all participants once again for their efforts and passion.
