## Project Overview

This project is a multiplayer nonsense quiz game developed as part of an object-oriented programming class. Using Java's socket programming, we implemented an online gaming platform that allows multiple users to participate in real time.

## Main features

1. **Real-time multiplayer**: Simultaneous multi-user connection using socket communication
2. **Nonsense Quiz System**: Provides nonsense questions of various difficulty levels.
3. **Scoring system**: Points awarded based on speed and accuracy of correct answers
4. **Real-time chat**: Chat function between users during the game
5. **Ranking system**: Ranking displayed based on usersâ€™ cumulative scores

## technology used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Network Programming**: Java Socket API
- **User Interface**: Java Swing
- **Concurrency Handling**: Java Concurrency Utilities
- **Data Storage**: File I/O, Serialization

## Development process

1. Requirements analysis and game logic design
2. Client-server architecture design
3. Implementation of network functions through socket programming
4. Game logic and user interface development
5. Simultaneous connection processing using multithreading
6. Testing and Debugging
7. Performance optimization

## Lessons learned and future plans

Through this project, I learned how to apply object-oriented design principles to real-world applications. In particular, I was able to gain an in-depth understanding of socket programming and multithreading concepts. In the future, we plan to permanently store user information through database linking and add more diverse game modes.
